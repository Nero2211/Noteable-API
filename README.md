# Noteable-API
RESTful API is a very interesting application which sits in between the database and client side application. I always wondered how API requests are handled, data is returned in JSON and how we deal with different HTTP calls i.e. POST, DELETE, UPDATE and so on.<br>
The best way to tackle this was to create a RESTful API in NODE.JS in conjuction with MongoDB from MLABS. <br>
This little project was capable of handling different types of HTTP requests while also dealing with different parameters passed within the URL such as: <br>
getAll (returns all the rows from the database), getByID (returns a specific row based on the primary key).
